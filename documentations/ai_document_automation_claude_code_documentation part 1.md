# PROJECT NAME

Doclos

Repository name recommended:

`doclos`

---

# PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Doclos is a document automation SaaS designed for small businesses and the German Mittelstand.

The product automatically processes business documents such as:

Invoices (Rechnungen)
Contracts (Verträge)
Offers (Angebote)
Delivery notes (Lieferscheine)

The system extracts structured data from PDFs and stores them in a searchable database.

Users can then:

search documents
validate extracted fields
export structured reports
export Excel for accounting

---

# PROBLEM

Most SMEs process documents manually.

Typical workflow today:

1. Receive PDF via email
2. Open PDF
3. Copy values into Excel
4. Save file
5. Create accounting entry manually

This costs time and introduces errors.

Many automation tools exist but are expensive.

Examples:

Docparser
Rossum
ABBYY FlexiCapture

These solutions cost thousands per year.

Doclos aims to provide a simpler solution.

# HIGH LEVEL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

System consists of five main layers.

1 Frontend

User interface.

Built with:

Next.js
React
TypeScript
TailwindCSS

Responsibilities:

Dashboard
Upload UI
Document viewer
Validation UI
Search
Export

---

2 Backend API

Handles application logic.

Recommended framework:

NestJS

Alternative:

Fastify + TypeScript

Responsibilities:

Authentication
File upload
Database access
Search
Export
Queue job creation

---

3 Worker Services

Background workers process heavy tasks.

Workers handle:

OCR
LLM parsing
Report generation
Excel export

Workers communicate via queue.

---

4 Data Layer

PostgreSQL database stores structured data.

Redis used for:

job queues
caching
rate limiting

---

5 Storage Layer

Object storage stores documents.

Recommended:

AWS S3

Alternative:

Cloudflare R2

Documents stored as:

uploads/YYYY/MM/DD/file.pdf

---

# EVENT FLOW

Document upload processing pipeline:

User uploads PDF

↓

Backend stores file in S3

↓

Document record created in DB

↓

Queue job created

↓

Worker downloads PDF

↓

Text extraction / OCR

↓

LLM parsing

↓

Validation rules

↓

Save structured data

↓

Frontend updates dashboard

---

# PROCESSING STATES

Each document has a status.

States:

uploaded
processing
parsed
needs_validation
validated
archived
error

---

# DOCUMENT TIMELINE FEATURE

The UI should show processing stages.

Example timeline:

Uploaded
Processing
OCR Completed
AI Extraction
Validation
Completed

This improves transparency.

---

# QUEUE SYSTEM

Queue required for background processing.

Recommended library:

BullMQ

Queue backend:

Redis

Jobs:

process_document
run_ocr
llm_parse
generate_excel
reprocess_document

Retry strategy:

exponential backoff

Dead letter queue required.

---

# DOCUMENT TYPES

System should classify documents automatically.

Possible types:

invoice
contract
offer
delivery_note
unknown

Classification done by LLM.

---

# STORAGE STRATEGY

Files stored in object storage.

Database only stores metadata.

Document table fields:

file_name
s3_key
file_size
page_count
mime_type

This avoids storing large binaries in database.

---

# SEARCH SYSTEM

Users must be able to search by:

invoice number
company name
amount
date

Implementation:

PostgreSQL full text search

Optional upgrade later:

Elasticsearch

---

# USER INTERFACE LANGUAGES

Supported languages:

English
German

Implementation:

i18n library

Recommended:

next-i18next

---

# AUTHENTICATION

Login options:

Email + password
Google OAuth
Microsoft OAuth

JWT tokens used for session.

---

# WHY THIS PROJECT IS STRONG FOR PORTFOLIO

Demonstrates:

Full stack development
AI integration
Document processing
Background workers
Database design
Cloud architecture

It looks like a real SaaS startup project.

# RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM (LOGICAL)

users
  │
  └── documents
        │
        └── invoices
              │
              └── invoice_items

customers
  │
  └── documents

---

# INDEX STRATEGY

Indexes required for fast queries.

Examples:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_documents_user
ON documents(user_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_number
ON invoices(invoice_number);

CREATE INDEX idx_invoices_date
ON invoices(invoice_date);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_name
ON customers(name);
```

Full text search index:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_search
ON customers
USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', name));
```

---

# DATA VALIDATION RULES

Invoice number must not be empty.

Invoice date must be valid ISO date.

Total amount must be >= 0.

VAT must be between 0 and 100.

Sum of invoice_items should approximately equal total amount.

Tolerance allowed: 0.5%.

---

# CONFIDENCE SYSTEM

Each extracted field includes a confidence score.

Range:

0.0 – 1.0

Interpretation:

>0.85 auto accepted

0.6–0.85 requires validation

<0.6 flagged as low confidence

Confidence is calculated using:

OCR token probability
LLM extraction reliability
Pattern validation

---

# HUMAN VALIDATION WORKFLOW

If confidence is low:

Document status becomes:

needs_validation

User interface shows:

PDF viewer
Editable fields
Confidence indicators

User edits values and confirms.

System writes audit log.

---

END OF PART 2

Next section will define:

AI Pipeline
OCR architecture
LLM prompt templates
Document classification system
Processing orchestration
