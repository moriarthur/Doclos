# PART 8 — INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT

This document defines the infrastructure and deployment strategy for Doclos.

Goals:

• scalable production-ready deployment
• support for both serverless and containerized options
• reliable object storage and database setup
• CI/CD pipeline for continuous updates
• cost-efficient architecture

---

# INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW

Components:

1. Frontend: Next.js app
2. Backend: Node.js / NestJS API
3. AI Workers: background processing for document extraction
4. Database: PostgreSQL
5. Object Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudflare R2
6. Queue: Redis (BullMQ)
7. Authentication: OAuth + JWT
8. Monitoring / Logging: CloudWatch / Sentry

---

# DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS

## Option 1 — Serverless

- Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
- Backend: AWS Lambda or Cloudflare Workers
- Queue: AWS SQS + Lambda triggers
- AI processing: Lambda functions or dedicated AI server
- Database: AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Storage: S3 or R2

Pros:
- No server maintenance
- Automatic scaling
- Pay-per-use

Cons:
- Cold starts
- Max execution time limits for AI processing (may need chunking)

---

## Option 2 — Docker + VPS

- Backend and AI workers in Docker containers
- Orchestrated by Docker Compose or Kubernetes
- Database: Postgres container or managed RDS
- Storage: S3 / R2
- Queue: Redis container

Pros:
- Full control
- Suitable for heavy AI tasks
- Easier local testing / reproducibility

Cons:
- Requires server maintenance
- Manual scaling unless Kubernetes used

---

## Option 3 — Hybrid

- Frontend serverless (Vercel)
- Backend + AI workers on Docker VPS or ECS
- Database managed (RDS)
- Storage: S3 or R2

Best for projects requiring heavy AI but want serverless frontend benefits.

---

# CI/CD PIPELINE

Tools:

- GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- Docker image build & push
- Automatic deployment to serverless or VPS
- Run tests (unit / integration)
- Linting and code formatting

Steps:

1. Push code to main branch
2. Run CI tests
3. Build Docker images (backend / workers)
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
5. Deploy backend and workers to ECS / VPS
6. Notify Slack / email

---

# DATABASE INFRASTRUCTURE

- PostgreSQL (managed RDS preferred)
- Backup: daily automated snapshots
- Replication: read replicas for scaling
- Security: SSL connections, encrypted at rest

---

# OBJECT STORAGE

- S3 or Cloudflare R2
- Bucket structure:
  /uploads/{user_id}/{document_id}/
  /exports/{user_id}/{export_id}/
- Encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Signed URLs for access
- Lifecycle policies (delete after retention period)

---

# QUEUE SYSTEM

- Redis + BullMQ for job queues
- Separate queues for:
  - document processing
  - exports
  - reprocessing
- Monitoring with Bull Board or custom dashboard
- Retry policies: exponential backoff, dead-letter queues

---

# MONITORING & LOGGING

- Application logging: Sentry / LogRocket
- Infrastructure monitoring: AWS CloudWatch / Grafana
- Metrics:
  - Queue length
  - Processing times
  - API response times
  - Error rates
- Alerts on failures or thresholds exceeded

---

# SCALING STRATEGY

- Horizontal scaling for AI workers
- Autoscaling frontend serverless functions
- Database read replicas
- Object storage: scalable by default (S3 / R2)
- Queue: Redis cluster for high volume

---

# DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST

- [ ] Environment variables configured (API keys, secrets, DB connection)
- [ ] TLS certificates installed
- [ ] IAM / bucket permissions set
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts configured
- [ ] Backups and snapshots verified
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline tested

---

# FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Kubernetes orchestration for multi-region deployments
- Auto-scaling AI GPU instances for faster OCR/LLM processing
- Multi-tenant isolation with separate storage buckets
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) for reproducibility
